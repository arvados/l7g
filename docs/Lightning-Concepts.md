Lightning Concepts
---

Lightning is a system that allows efficient access to
large scale population genomic data with a focus
on clinical and research use.
Lightning's primary focus is human genomic
data, but this could be extended to encompass other organisms.
Genomes are stored in a compressed format that compromises
between size and accessibility.
Additional data data sources, such as phenotype data from
the Harvard Personal Genome Project and variant data from
the ClinVar database, are added for practical use.

The Lightning system is a combination of a conceptual way
to think about genomes (genomic tiling),
the internal representation of genomes for efficient access
(the compact genome format and auxiliary data), and
software that manages access to the data.
